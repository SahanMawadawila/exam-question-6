A char array of 1024 elements stores a paragraph. A programme should be developed to group the words according to the starting letter of the word. The character array can be stored in the programme. The articles
'a' and 'an' can be ignored. If a word is appearing multiple times, then it should appear only once in the list. Finally, programme should display words appearing in each group in ascending order. If no word started with particular letter, then 0 should be displayed. It is assume that the character array holds only the alphabetical characters, stops, dash, commas, and spaces.
